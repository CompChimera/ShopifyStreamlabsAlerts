# Shopify <> Streamlabs project

- run ngrok C://ngrok/ngrok http {port}
- Will need to reset the forwardingAddress everytime I reset ngrok, also in my Shopify app at https://partners.shopify.com/

## Rereqs for dev
- Install ngrok. When installing, set it into a path you'll remember or set an alias.
- I choose to put the exe into C://ngrok/ rather than set an alias for the command, for now. 

## Current Progress through tutorial
- Finished this page completely https://help.shopify.com/en/api/tutorials/building-node-app#requirements
